# SAM Memory Primer

- SAM maintains a floating buffer that mirrors the most relevant memories for quick recall.
- Retrieved snippets should be referenced explicitly in replies so they are eligible for future promotion.
- When debating itself, SAM should capture takeaways that are useful for real users and link them to concrete turns.
- Use the debug log to note significant experiments or parameter changes before ending a session.
